## cgrep
**WIP**

A simple, but nontrivial regular expression matcher. 

The program converts a regular expression into a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), and then simulates the NFA on a given text string to see whether it matches the pattern.

The regex to NFA conversion algorithm is from Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms book, while the two stack NFA simulation algorithm is from the Dragon Book.

More info and features will be added soon.
